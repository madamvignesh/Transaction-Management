 Transaction Management System

 Overview

TMS represents a transaction management system designed with safety, reliability, and efficiency in mind for processing financial transactions. Through it, users can view, create, and manage transactions with integrity in financial records. The system is targeted for use by organizations with a need to handle financial activities like deposits, withdrawals, as well as real-time monitoring of transaction status.

The basic objective of this system is to track and query transactions smoothly, so that every transaction is documented, reviewed, and updated accordingly. The emphasis of the system is keeping things user-friendly at the frontend and strong at the backend; thus, it takes care of various types of transactions while handling secure data with care.

 Key Features


 1. Transaction Creation
This system has a core function, which is to create a new transaction; a user can initiate a transaction by filling in information such as:

- Transaction ID: Unique identifier for every single transaction.
- User ID: ID associated with the user.
- Amount: The amount of the transaction.
- Transaction Type: A transaction type (DEPOSIT or WITHDRAWAL).
- Timestamp: The exact time when the transaction occurred.
- Status: This can be pending or already completed.

When a transaction is created, the system generates a unique transaction ID for each entry in order to maintain the integrity and traceability of financial operations.

 2. Transaction Tracking
Once a transaction is initiated, the system enables the user to track and monitor the same in real-time. The transactions are stored in the database with all their relevant details and can be queried in order to ascertain the current status. The details of the transaction whether completed, pending, or even waiting for approval, the user can view the transaction details through the system's API.

Users can search information for transactions based on transaction IDs.
- The user also filters transactions by using user ID, so they can view their own transactions, or for some particular user, how their transaction history looks.
  API calls are answered with technical details on the transactions: an amount, transaction type, timestamp, and status in the current time.
 
 3. Updates for Transaction Status
The Transaction Management System also supports status updates. This allows transactions to be marked as either "PENDING" or "COMPLETED." When a transaction is created, it is initially set to "PENDING" status. When the transaction is processed or finalized, the status is updated to "COMPLETED."

It facilitates tracking the lifecycle of a transaction and facilitates real-time updates. The status of a transaction can be updated via API calls by authorized users or system admins.

 4. Data Security and Integrity
The system ensures that all data is handled securely, and all transactions are processed in compliance with industry standards. The money deals with the financial data, so it is important that the system contains broad security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

The Transaction Management System uses the following measures to ensure security:

- Safe Data Storage: All transaction data is safely stored in the database. Information like user IDs, transaction amounts, and timestamps are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
- Access Control: The ability to perform specific tasks, like adding transactions or updating transaction statuses, is restricted to registered and authorized users only. 
- Audit Trails: All transactions performed in the system are recorded together with a timestamp and a unique ID. This is made to maintain transparency and accountability.

All database interactions are conducted using SQL prepared statements so that SQL injection attacks cannot take place, and HTTPS is also enforced for the client-side communication with the server.

 5. No Deletion of Transactions
The system does not allow for any form of transaction deletion, as part of the security and accountability measures. This is to ensure that financial records are never lost and cannot be altered. This, in turn, ensures a consistent and reliable audit trail.

In case there is a need to delete or remove any transaction from the system, one must understand that it has to be authorized by a higher authority. Deletion of financial transactions is a very high-security operation, which can be taken up by only those personnel that are authorized with the clearance level that would allow such a move.

As a security measure, users are not allowed to delete transactions directly by the system. Should a transaction need to be deleted (for instance, an error was made or fraudulent transaction), then the users must report the occurrence to the security department or high-level administrator of the organization. The organization will then make the proper move in accordance with the security protocols of the organization.

 6. Transaction History Live
With this system, users can monitor their real-time transaction history and check the status of their transactions. The Backend of the system can process queries retrieving transaction records filtered by a transaction ID or user ID; thus, users are able to see a consistent view of their transaction history and follow transactions as they occur.

Through API calls, the users can filter the transactions based on specific fields like transaction ID, user ID, transaction type, and transaction status. This way, it is easy to pull out detailed reports, and financial records become readily accessible.

 7. Flexible API for Transaction Management
The system comes with a flexible API for transaction management, which enables developers to interact programmatically with the transaction records. Its flexible API supports:

- Create a transaction: by sending a POST request where details are contained in the request body.
Fetching transactions and searching for a specific one: through a GET request where a number of transactions are retrieved either by transaction ID, user ID or any other required parameter.
Update the status of a transaction: in that, developers can update the status of the transaction from pending to completed using the PUT request.

These APIs form an essential interface for integrating the Transaction Management System with existing systems or by customizing solutions for tracking and managing transactions.
 Security Considerations
While the system provides efficient transaction management, data security and privacy are also strongholds of the system. Any financial transaction involved sensitive information, which needs protection; thus, the system incorporates mechanisms for authentication and authorization to limit access to authorized personnel only.

To delete a transaction, one therefore has to have high-security clearances as this prohibits people from deleting transactions without proper authorization and thus safeguards the integrity of the financial systems.

 Conclusion
The Transaction Management System will be an optimal answer for an overall, secure transaction management and tracking process. All transactions are recorded with proper details, giving real-time information on the status of transactions, and data integrity is ensured. Such a system implemented for users allows an efficient monitoring of financial transactions and complying with regulatory requirements from the industrial side towards security and transparency standards.

Although the direct deleting of a transaction is forbidden in this system, this deletion policy will ensure the retention of integrity for the financial record and is thereby requiring a high-level authorization for any deletions to avoid fraudulent or spurious activity.
